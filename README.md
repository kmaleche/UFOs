To search through sighting records, input search values into the available fields (Date, City, State, Country, and Shape). The page will reload the data upon input, showing only the records that match those parameters.

## Summary:
 - One drawback of the page in its current form is the limited size of the dataset from which it draws -- A more robust compilation of sightings would yeild more fruitful results upon filtering.
 - Another recommendation would be to add chart visualizations, like a geogrpahic heatmap or some other way of displaying the regional data in a more visual way.
